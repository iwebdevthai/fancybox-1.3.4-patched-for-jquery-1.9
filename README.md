Fancybox v1.3.4 patched to work with jQuery v1.9.0
=====================================

This is an unofficial patch and is unsupported by Fancybox's author, however it works as is. You may use it at your own risk ;)

Fancybox doesn't work with jQuery v1.9.0 [ f.browser is undefined / Cannot read property 'msie' ], and this solves that problem.

You can use Fancybox v2.1.5 with jQuery 1.9, so that may be a better solution than using this tweak.
